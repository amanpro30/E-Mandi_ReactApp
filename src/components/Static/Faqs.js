                  Agri MarketPlace and its partners have agreements with the
                  main port operators, allowing the customer to deliver /
                  collect the goods advance, thus avoiding delays. We also offer
                  transport solutions between the client's facilities and the
                  terminal to complement the existing fleet and ensure no
                  interruption of loading/unloading operations.

                  properly conditioned for the loading, unloading and transport
                  of this type of products at reduced costs. Therefore we do not
                  have any imposed quantity restrictions.
